# CLaaS with AutoCL: material

Toward Continual-Learning-as-a-Service with fully auto-adaptive learning (AutoCL) methods and systems. 

The goal is to make large-scale learning automatic, adaptive and more robust, efficient and easy to use. 

Here, is a list of materials useful to realize this challenging and exciting project.

## Machine Learning System (MLSyS) and MLOps

In this section, we maintain a list of all papers, site docs and tools produced on MLSys and MLOps.

## Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

In this section, we collect a list of all papers, site docs and systems produced on AutoML.

## Continual Learning

In this section, we report links to papers and tools mainly taken from ContinualAI.


## Continual-Learning-as-a-Service and AutoCL methods and systems

Here we maintain a list of all the papers on the CLaaS paradigm, AutoCL and related topics.
